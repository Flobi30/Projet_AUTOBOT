To perform an audit of the Python code under the `src/` directory, we will follow a structured approach to identify dead code, complexity hotspots, and dependency bloat. Below is a detailed outline of the steps involved in the audit process, along with the expected output.

### Step 1: Analyze Python Code

1. **Dead/Unused Code Detection**:
   - Identify functions, imports, and variables that are defined but never used.
   - Use tools like `vulture` or `flake8` to automate the detection of unused code.

2. **Complexity Hotspots**:
   - Identify functions that exceed 20 lines of code or contain nested loops.
   - Use tools like `radon` to measure cyclomatic complexity and identify hotspots.

3. **Dependency Bloat**:
   - Analyze `requirements.txt` to find packages that are not imported in the codebase.
   - Use tools like `pipreqs` or `pip-check` to identify unused dependencies.

### Step 2: Produce a Report

The report will include:

- **List of Items to Remove or Refactor**:
  - Unused functions, imports, and variables.
  - Functions that exceed the complexity threshold and suggestions for refactoring.

- **Suggestions to Improve Project Structure**:
  - Recommendations for folder layout (e.g., separating tests, documentation, and source code).
  - Naming conventions for files and directories.

- **Cleaned-Up Version of `requirements.txt`**:
  - A revised list of dependencies that are actually used in the codebase.

### Step 3: Output

1. **`docs/audit_report.md`**: This file will contain the findings from the audit, structured as follows:

```markdown
# Audit Report

## Dead/Unused Code
- **Unused Functions**:
  - `function_name` in `module.py`
- **Unused Imports**:
  - `import_name` in `module.py`
- **Unused Variables**:
  - `variable_name` in `module.py`

## Complexity Hotspots
- **Functions Exceeding 20 Lines**:
  - `function_name` in `module.py` (XX lines)
- **Nested Loops**:
  - `function_name` in `module.py`

## Suggestions for Refactoring
- Refactor `function_name` to reduce complexity by breaking it into smaller functions.

## Project Structure Suggestions
- Consider creating a `tests/` directory for unit tests.
- Organize modules into subdirectories based on functionality.

## Cleaned-Up Requirements
- Removed unused dependencies:
  - `unused_package`
- Updated `requirements.txt`:
```

2. **Updated `requirements.txt`**: This file will contain only the necessary dependencies.

### Example of Updated `requirements.txt`

```plaintext
# Updated requirements.txt
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.25.1
# Removed unused dependencies
```

### Conclusion

By following this structured approach, we will ensure that the Python codebase is clean, maintainable, and efficient. The audit report will serve as a comprehensive guide for developers to improve the project and maintain high code quality. 

### Next Steps

1. Run the necessary tools to gather data on unused code and dependencies.
2. Compile the findings into the `docs/audit_report.md`.
3. Update the `requirements.txt` based on the analysis. 

Once the analysis is complete, the final outputs will be generated as specified.
