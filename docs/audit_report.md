To conduct a thorough audit of the Python code under the `src/` directory, we will follow a structured approach. Below is a detailed outline of the steps involved in the analysis, along with the expected output.

### Step 1: Analyze Python Code

1. **Identify Dead/Unused Code:**
   - Scan for functions, imports, and variables that are defined but never used.
   - Use tools like `vulture` or `flake8` to assist in identifying unused code.

2. **Identify Complexity Hotspots:**
   - Look for functions that exceed 20 lines of code.
   - Identify nested loops that may indicate complexity issues.
   - Use tools like `radon` to measure cyclomatic complexity.

3. **Identify Dependency Bloat:**
   - Review `requirements.txt` for packages that are not imported in the codebase.
   - Use tools like `pipreqs` or `pip-check` to help identify unused dependencies.

### Step 2: Produce a Report

1. **List of Items to Remove or Refactor:**
   - Compile a list of unused functions, imports, and variables.
   - List functions that are too complex and suggest refactoring strategies.

2. **Suggestions to Improve Project Structure:**
   - Recommend a folder layout that enhances organization (e.g., separating modules, tests, and documentation).
   - Suggest naming conventions for files and directories to improve clarity.

3. **Cleaned-Up Version of `requirements.txt`:**
   - Provide an updated `requirements.txt` that only includes necessary dependencies.

### Step 3: Output

1. **Generate `docs/audit_report.md`:**
   - Document findings, including unused code, complexity hotspots, and suggestions for improvement.

2. **Update `requirements.txt`:**
   - Create a new version of `requirements.txt` with only the required dependencies.

### Example Output

#### `docs/audit_report.md`

```markdown
# Audit Report

## Dead/Unused Code
- **Unused Functions:**
  - `function_name` in `module.py` (line 10)
- **Unused Imports:**
  - `import unused_module` in `module.py` (line 1)
- **Unused Variables:**
  - `unused_variable` in `function_name` (line 15)

## Complexity Hotspots
- **Functions Exceeding 20 Lines:**
  - `complex_function` in `module.py` (lines 25-50)
- **Nested Loops:**
  - Found in `another_function` in `module.py` (lines 60-80)

## Suggestions for Project Structure
- **Folder Layout:**
  - Consider creating a `tests/` directory for unit tests.
  - Separate `docs/` for documentation.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Use lowercase with underscores for file names (e.g., `my_module.py`).

## Dependency Bloat
- **Unused Dependencies:**
  - `unused_package` can be removed from `requirements.txt`.

```

#### Updated `requirements.txt`

```plaintext
# Updated requirements.txt
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.25.1
# Removed unused_package
```

### Conclusion

This structured approach will ensure a comprehensive audit of the Python codebase, leading to improved code quality, maintainability, and project organization. The final outputs will provide clear guidance on necessary changes and enhancements.
